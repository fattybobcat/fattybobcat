### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I continue to study the features of Python (Lutz, Python to the heights of mastery, Luciano Ramal), algorithms (Grokay's book Algorithms, articles on HabrÃ©), deploying applications on servers, network structure and solving problems.

I am persistent in solving difficult and interesting problems and I am happy when I have achieved results. I love when everything is done on time. I am interested in the success of the business, although it is sometimes a series of routine tasks in order for the project to be completed successfully.
